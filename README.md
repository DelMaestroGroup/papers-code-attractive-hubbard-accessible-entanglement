### Abstract
The complicated ways in which electrons interact in many-body systems such as most molecules and materials have long been viewed through the lens of local electron correlation and associated correlation functions. However, quantum information science has shown that more global measures of quantum systems like the entanglement entropy can provide a second complementary and clarifying lens on electronic behavior. One particularly useful form of the entanglement entropy is the accessible entanglement, the entanglement available to a system subject to fixed particle number due to superselection rules as a quantum resource \BR{maybe rearrange sentence?}. In this work, we derive and demonstrate how to compute the accessible entanglement and related symmetry-resolved entanglements for fully interacting fermion systems \BR{for the first time - maybe remove?}, and employ these measures to characterize the BEC--BCS crossover in the attractive Hubbard model. We show that these entanglements and their related particle and spin probability distribution functions more clearly resolve \BR{changes in how the electrons behave} around the crossover than the unresolved entanglement entropy and even correlation functions conventionally used to describe this model. To compute these measures, we combine a new recursive auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that works in the canonical ensemble with \BR{a modified version of the swap algorithm...Tong fill in}. Overall, this work provides new means of characterizing the entanglement within quantum systems that can grant an even deeper understanding of the complicated electronic behavior that underlies quantum phase transitions and crossovers.
